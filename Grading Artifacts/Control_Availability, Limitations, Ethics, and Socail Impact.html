    <h1>Availability</h1>
    <p>
        Data supporting this product are provided by the dbpedia project created and maintained by the University of Mannheim and Leipzig University, in Germany. Dbpedia integrates and makes available information from Wikipedia and the wikimedia foundation. Access to the data can be found here: <a href="https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/latest-core/">https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/latest-core/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Integration with obsidian was supported by the obsidian plugin documentation: <a href="https://docs.obsidian.md/Home">https://docs.obsidian.md/Home</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        This project will be released open-source, with accompanying documentation, to allow its usage and extension by anyone that might find it useful.

    <h1>Ethics</h1>
    <p>
        The largest ethical concern for this project is around attribution of data and the transparency of how the rich context of RDF data is simplified into markdown. Making sure to balance the needs of the user in configuring their import while making sure that the final information embedded into markdown files doesn't misrepresent the truth is a key consideration when developing this integration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another major concern is in creating the ability to import massive amounts of data into obsidian as a whole. While the graphs are created locally, obsidian sync lets people clone that into the cloud. It's of the utmost importance that warnings and limitations be put into place rather than allowing a user to fill the remainder of their hard drive with 900 million RDF triples.
    </p>

    <h1>Limitations</h1>
    <p>
        There are a few major limitations of a product like this - the first is the inherent challenge of making sure that the users know what it is that they're pulling into a document. Because there's no easy way to integrate an RDF browser into the obsidian plugin UI, users of the plugin will have to pull the selected triples into their notes app and then either undo the process or edit the results to align with their specific needs. This limits the findability of relevant information in the plugin and ultimately reduces the portability of the backing RDF data.
    </p>

    <h1>Societal Impact</h1>
    <p>
        The expected benefits of this project are to allow users to avoid having to duplicate the collective labor of the many contributors of the wikimedia project when managing personal knowledge, but instead allow them to focus on tuning that knowledge to their individual ends. For example, a travel agent who's working on an itinerary can pull the information on the history of a tourist destination and then add the specifics of guides and restaurants that they recommend in the area. They can automatically get the semantic context of the location of the destination and have it linked to others in the same city and country.
